## Requirements
 * The Simsâ„¢ 4
 * [GDrive Save files folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1f1nGYSPDRB9sMwHuP3Ou04Mb7D-MnE95)
## Notes
- A long list of files with names like *Slot_00000001.save* or *Slot_00000001.save.ver1* (Each file number has up to six versions)
- The .save file extension is the primary version of that save point.

 * This image above is the folder that you can find file that would load if you launched the game and continued from where you left off 
 * Other saves under that folder represent older points within that saved game. The higher the version number, the older the file (.ver4 is the oldest save point)
## Restoring Save Files
* Decide the save point you want to use
* Make sure to close the game. (Never alter game files while the game is running.)
* Select the primary version of the save file (the one with the .save file extension) and move it to another folder location for safe-keeping.
* Choose the new save file you want to load. You will have a set of files that all have the file extensions marking them as older versions of that save point.
  *  To revert the smallest amount of time and progress, choose the file with .save.ver0.
  *  To revert the most time and progress within this save, choose the file with .save.ver4.
* Make the file you choose become the new primary save point.
  * Right-click the file and choose *Rename*.
  * Delete the part of the file name after *.save*.
  * Click Enter.
  * **Example**: Slot_000000012.save.ver4 should now be Slot_000000012.save
* Launch the game and choose Load Game. Select the save point you want to open, and the game will load the file you renamed as the primary for that save point.
